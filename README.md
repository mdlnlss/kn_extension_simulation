# Simulation Study Extension for KNIME

> **Work in Progress**

This repository is the home of the Simulation Study Extension for KNIME Analytics Platform. The extension provides a set of nodes for Design of Experiments (DoE) and simulation model execution.

The extension is developed by Madlene Leißau from the Research Group Industry Analytics at the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and KNIME as part of a Proof of Concept (PoC). The goal of the collaboration is to develop KNIME Analytics Platform extensions and best-practice workflows to provide a consistent and compatible platform for simulation studies across disciplines and simulation tools.

## Installation
